Queue is an open-source module that can help you quickly organize actions in a script.

## Why choose Queue?

As a preface the inspiration behind Queue derives from my tendency to visualize programming as a play with scripts being directors and functions being cue's that are called as the game is played.

With that being said Queue aims to aid in delegating task in a more First to last fashion.
